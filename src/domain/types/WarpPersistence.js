 * Instead of casting to `any` when accessing persistence methods,

 * NOTE: CommitPort, BlobPort, TreePort, and RefPort each contain both
 * read and write methods. True read/write separation would require
 * splitting each port, which is deferred. For now, the role-named
 * aliases below are identical — they exist to document *intent* at
 * each call site, not to enforce access restrictions.
