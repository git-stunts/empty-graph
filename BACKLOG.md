## 2026-02-25 Follow-Ups

- Deno image smoke gate for native fallback prerequisites (`node-gyp` + bootstrap install probe).
- Safe PR-comment helper script to eliminate shell quoting/substitution errors (`scripts/pr-comment-safe.sh`).
- CI-ready `pr:health` task that combines unresolved-thread count, check statuses, and review quorum.
- Pre-merge CI gate: fail when unresolved review threads remain (including outdated unresolved threads).
- Pre-merge CI gate: fail when required review quorum is not met.
- Reduce runtime fragility around external prebuilt binaries by documenting and testing fallback behavior explicitly.
- Add an explicit local `test:deno:smoke` command for fast pre-push confidence.
- Add markdownlint to pre-commit to catch MD024 (duplicate headings) and MD040 (fenced code language) before review.
- Consider a `no-empty-catch` ESLint rule (or at least `no-catch-without-comment`) to prevent silent error swallowing.
