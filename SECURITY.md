# Security Model

@git-stunts/git-warp is designed with security-by-default principles, treating the underlying Git binary as an untrusted subsystem through the `@git-stunts/plumbing` layer.

## 🛡️ Security Through Plumbing

This library inherits all security protections from `@git-stunts/plumbing`:

- **Command Sanitization**: All Git commands are validated through a strict whitelist
- **Argument Injection Prevention**: Refs are validated against strict patterns to prevent command injection
- **No Arbitrary Commands**: Only safe Git plumbing commands are permitted
- **Environment Isolation**: Git processes run in a clean environment with minimal variables

## 🚫 Ref Validation

The `GitGraphAdapter` validates all ref arguments to prevent injection attacks:

- Refs must match the pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]+((~\d*|\^\d*|\.\.[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]+)*)$`
- Refs cannot start with `-` or `--` to prevent option injection
- Invalid refs throw an error immediately

## 🌊 Resource Protection

- **Streaming-First**: Large graph traversals use async generators to prevent OOM
- **Bitmap Indexing**: Sharded Roaring Bitmap indexes enable O(1) lookups without loading entire graphs
- **Delimiter Safety**: Uses ASCII Record Separator (`\x1E`) to prevent message collision

## Sync Authentication (SHIELD)

### Overview

The HTTP sync protocol supports optional HMAC-SHA256 request signing with replay protection. When enabled, every sync request must carry a valid signature computed over a canonical payload that includes the request body, timestamp, and a unique nonce.

### Threat Model

**Protected against:**
- Unauthorized sync requests from unknown peers
- Replay attacks (nonce-based, with 5-minute TTL window)
- Request body tampering (HMAC covers body SHA-256)
- Timing attacks on signature comparison (`timingSafeEqual`)

**Not protected against:**
- Compromised shared secrets (rotate keys immediately if leaked)
- Denial-of-service (body size limits provide basic protection, but no rate limiting)
- Man-in-the-middle without TLS (use HTTPS in production)

### Authentication Flow

1. Client computes SHA-256 of request body
2. Client builds canonical payload: `warp-v1|KEY_ID|METHOD|PATH|TIMESTAMP|NONCE|CONTENT_TYPE|BODY_SHA256`
3. Client computes HMAC-SHA256 of canonical payload using shared secret
4. Client sends 5 auth headers: `x-warp-sig-version`, `x-warp-key-id`, `x-warp-timestamp`, `x-warp-nonce`, `x-warp-signature`
5. Server validates header formats (cheap checks first)
6. Server checks clock skew (default: 5 minutes)
7. Server reserves nonce atomically (prevents replay)
8. Server resolves key by key-id
9. Server recomputes HMAC and compares with constant-time equality

### Enforcement Modes

- **`enforce`** (default): Rejects requests that fail authentication with appropriate HTTP status codes (400/401/403). No request details leak in error responses.
- **`log-only`**: Logs authentication failures but allows requests through. Use during rollout to identify issues before enforcing.

### Error Response Hygiene

External error responses use coarse status codes and generic reason strings:
- `400` — Malformed headers (version, timestamp, nonce, signature format)
- `401` — Missing auth headers, unknown key-id, invalid signature
- `403` — Expired timestamp, replayed nonce

Detailed diagnostics (exact failure reason, key-id, peer info) are sent to the structured logger only.

### Nonce Cache and Restart Semantics

The nonce cache is an in-memory LRU (default capacity: 100,000 entries). On server restart, the cache is empty. This means:
- Nonces from before the restart can be replayed within the 5-minute clock skew window
- This is an accepted trade-off for simplicity; persistent nonce storage is not implemented in v1
- For higher security, keep the clock skew window small and use TLS

### Key Rotation

Key management uses a key-id system for zero-downtime rotation:

1. Add the new key-id and secret to the server's `keys` map
2. Deploy the server
3. Update clients to use the new key-id
4. Remove the old key-id from the server's `keys` map
5. Deploy again

Multiple key-ids can coexist indefinitely.

### Configuration

**Server (`serve()`):**
```js
await graph.serve({
  port: 3000,
  httpPort: new NodeHttpAdapter(),
  auth: {
    keys: { default: 'your-shared-secret' },
    mode: 'enforce', // or 'log-only'
  },
});
```

**Client (`syncWith()`):**
```js
await graph.syncWith('http://peer:3000', {
  auth: {
    secret: 'your-shared-secret',
    keyId: 'default',
  },
});
```
